# Multi-Agent Communication Protocol (MCP) - Architecture and Communication

The Multi-Agent Communication Protocol (MCP) is a framework that enables structured communication and collaboration between multiple AI agents. This document explains its architecture, communication mechanisms, and applications in the financial domain.

## ðŸ§© Components of MCP Architecture

### 1. **Orchestrator**
- Central control unit that manages workflow.
- Coordinates agent activities and assigns tasks.
- Makes high-level decisions about task routing.
- Synthesizes final outputs for user consumption.

### 2. **Agents**
- Specialized AI models with specific expertise domains.
- Process assigned tasks within their specialty area.
- Communicate outcomes to orchestrator and other agents.
- Request information when needed to complete tasks.

### 3. **Shared Knowledge Base**
- Centralized repository accessible to all agents.
- Stores shared information and maintains workflow state.
- Preserves history of agent interactions and decisions.
- Enables asynchronous information sharing.

### 4. **External Data Sources**
- APIs, databases, and real-time feeds.
- Provide up-to-date information for decision-making.
- May include market data, regulatory info, etc.

## ðŸ”„ MCP Communication Steps

1. **Query Initiation**  
   User submits a request; orchestrator plans execution.

2. **Task Decomposition**  
   Orchestrator splits the query into manageable subtasks.

3. **Task Assignment**  
   Tasks are assigned to appropriate agents.

4. **Information Exchange**  
   Agents use a shared knowledge base and may communicate with one another.

5. **Result Consolidation**  
   Orchestrator collects all results and prepares the final output for the user.
